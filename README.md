# ADAPTIVE XAI with Tree of Thoughts

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Python 3.7+ (3.10 in the set up)
- OpenAI API key
- PostgreSQL GUI client


## Setup the environmwnt
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Steps

1. Set up Docker environment
2. Connect to the database using a PostgreSQL GUI client such as TablePlus
3. Create a Python script to insert document chunks as vectors using LLM text embeddings (Mistral, OpenAI)
4. Create a Python function to perform similarity search


## Detailed Instructions

### 1. Set up Docker environment

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the following content:

```yaml
services:
  timescaledb:
    image: timescale/timescaledb-ha:pg16
    container_name: timescaledb
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_DB=postgres
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    volumes:
      - timescaledb_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  timescaledb_data:
```

Run the Docker container:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### 2. Connect to the database using a PostgreSQL GUI client

- Open client
- Create a new connection with the following details:
  - Host: localhost
  - Port: 5432
  - User: postgres
  - Password: password
  - Database: postgres

### 3. Run ollama locally in docker

ollama pull mistral
ollama run mistral

### 4. Create a Python script to insert document chunks as vectors

See `insert_vectors.py` for the implementation. This script uses OpenAI's `text-embedding-3-small` model to generate embeddings.

## Usage

1. Create a copy of `example.env` and rename it to `.env`
2. Open `.env` and fill in your OpenAI API key if using OpenAI. Leave the database settings as is
3. Run the Docker container
4. Install the required Python packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Execute `insert_vectors.py` to populate the database
6. Play with `example.py` to perform adax task


## Paper Experiments

Run experiments via ``sh scripts/{adax}/{standard_sampling, cot_sampling, bfs}.sh``.
The very simple ``run.py`` implements the ToT + BFS algorithm, as well as the naive IO/CoT sampling. Some key arguments:

- ``--naive_run``: if True, run naive IO/CoT sampling instead of ToT + BFS.
-  ``--prompt_sample`` (choices=[``standard``, ``cot``]): sampling prompt
- ``--method_generate`` (choices=[``sample``, ``propose``]): thought generator, whether to sample independent thoughts (used in Creative Writing) or propose sequential thoughts (used in Game of 24)
- ``--method_evaluate`` (choices=[``value``, ``vote``]): state evaluator, whether to use the value states independently (used in Game of 24) or vote on states together (used in Creative Writing)
- ``--n_generate_sample``: number of times to prompt for thought generation
- ``--n_evaluate_sample``: number of times to prompt for state evaluation
- ``--n_select_sample``: number of states to keep from each step (i.e. ``b`` in the paper's ToT + BFS algorithm)



## Paper Trajectories
``logs/`` contains all the trajectories from the paper's experiments, except for ``logs/game24/gpt-4_0.7_propose1_value3_greedy5_start900_end1000.json`` which was reproduced after the paper (as the original experiment was done in a notebook) and achieved a 69\% score instead of the original 74\% score due to randomness in GPT decoding. We hope to aggregate multiple runs in the future to account for sampling randomness and update the paper, but this shouldn't affect the main conclusions of the paper.

## How to Add A New Task
Setting up a new task is easy, and mainly involves two steps.
* Set up a new task class in ``tot/tasks/`` and task files in ``tot/data/``. See ``tot/tasks/game24.py`` for an example. Add the task to ``tot/tasks/__init__.py``.
* Set up task-specific prompts in ``tot/prompts/``. See ``tot/prompts/game24.py`` for an example. Depending on the nature of the task, choose ``--method_generate`` (choices=[``sample``, ``propose``]) and ``--method_evaluate`` (choices=[``value``, ``vote``]) and their corresponding prompts.

## Why PostgreSQL?

Using PostgreSQL with pgvectorscale as your vector database offers several key advantages over dedicated vector databases:

- PostgreSQL is a robust, open-source database with a rich ecosystem of tools, drivers, and connectors. This ensures transparency, community support, and continuous improvements.

- By using PostgreSQL, you can manage both your relational and vector data within a single database. This reduces operational complexity, as there's no need to maintain and synchronize multiple databases.

- Pgvectorscale enhances pgvector with faster search capabilities, higher recall, and efficient time-based filtering. It leverages advanced indexing techniques, such as the DiskANN-inspired index, to significantly speed up Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) searches.

Pgvectorscale Vector builds on top of [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector), offering improved performance and additional features, making PostgreSQL a powerful and versatile choice for AI applications.

## Using ANN search indexes to speed up queries

Timescale Vector offers indexing options to accelerate similarity queries, particularly beneficial for large vector datasets (10k+ vectors):

1. Supported indexes:
   - timescale_vector_index (default): A DiskANN-inspired graph index
   - pgvector's HNSW: Hierarchical Navigable Small World graph index
   - pgvector's IVFFLAT: Inverted file index

2. The DiskANN-inspired index is Timescale's latest offering, providing improved performance. Refer to the [Timescale Vector explainer blog](https://www.timescale.com/blog/pgvector-is-now-as-fast-as-pinecone-at-75-less-cost/) for detailed information and benchmarks.

For optimal query performance, creating an index on the embedding column is recommended, especially for large vector datasets.

## Cosine Similarity in Vector Search

### What is Cosine Similarity?

Cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors in a multi-dimensional space. It's a measure of orientation rather than magnitude.

- Range: -1 to 1 (for normalized vectors, which is typical in text embeddings)
- 1: Vectors point in the same direction (most similar)
- 0: Vectors are orthogonal (unrelated)
- -1: Vectors point in opposite directions (most dissimilar)

### Cosine Distance

In pgvector, the `<=>` operator computes cosine distance, which is 1 - cosine similarity.

- Range: 0 to 2
- 0: Identical vectors (most similar)
- 1: Orthogonal vectors
- 2: Opposite vectors (most dissimilar)

### Interpreting Results

When you get results from similarity_search:

- Lower distance values indicate higher similarity.
- A distance of 0 would mean exact match (rarely happens with embeddings).
- Distances closer to 0 indicate high similarity.
- Distances around 1 suggest little to no similarity.
- Distances approaching 2 indicate opposite meanings (rare in practice).
