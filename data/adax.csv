high;low;high;45;3;Understanding why Overcooked AI chooses a specific path;The AI picks the shortest safe route based on the food order.;The AI calculates all possible paths and selects the one that minimizes time while avoiding collisions.;First, the AI looks at the food order. Then, it checks all routes. Finally, it picks the shortest path that avoids collisions.;8
low;high;low;78;1;Explaining why the AI prioritized one order over another;It picks the order that will expire first.;The AI checks order timers and prioritizes the one that will expire soonest.;Step 1: The AI looks at all pending orders. Step 2: It checks their timers. Step 3: It picks the one with the least time left.;9
high;low;high;30;5;Why does the AI take a longer path when another looks shorter?;It avoids congestion from teammates.;Though another path looks shorter, it may have obstacles or teammates blocking it, so the AI chooses a more efficient overall route.;Step 1: AI checks available paths. Step 2: It estimates potential obstacles. Step 3: It picks a slightly longer but less crowded path.;7
low;medium;low;60;2;Why does the AI change its movement pattern mid-task?;It adapts to teammate actions.;The AI monitors teammate movement and updates its strategy to avoid delays.;Step 1: The AI follows its planned path. Step 2: It detects changes in teammate movement. Step 3: It recalculates a better path based on new data.;8
